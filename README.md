## 👋 About Me

A data-driven problem solver With over 3 years of experience in retail analytics and operations, I specialize in transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that drive measurable business impact.

I’ve worked on everything from optimizing inventory and predicting churn to building sentiment-based recommendation systems using NLP. My toolkit includes SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and cloud platforms like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker.

Currently based in the U.S., I’m open to full-time opportunities starting July 2025 in roles like **Data Analyst**, **Business Analyst**, or **Product Analyst**.

🧠 I believe great decisions come from good data — and better questions.
